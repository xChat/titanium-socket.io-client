Socket IO client 1.45, tested with server 1.4.5 too.

Use:

Rename socket.io_working_reformatted.js to socket.io.js and replace in
the socket io client you downloaded


Will do a not re-formatted version soon.


Disabled compression:

Line: 2076 of the re-formatted version
```// disable this to get around of a global.Buffer undefined error```
```   if (false && self.perMessageDeflate) {```
